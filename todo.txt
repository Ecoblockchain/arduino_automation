how this rpgoram will work

There will be scripts to communicate with devices.  
A master program will be able to acces all these scripts

This master program will do the following.

-Keep a database of devices on the network and they're surrent state
	(devices can ping the server when booting up and tell them there state.  good incase power goes out)
-Keep databases of information recived from devices (when necessary)
	-A temp sensor can feed data to it
-Have access to port on the computer.  This port will face the world so users can control their home automation network from anywhere
	ithis needs to be secure.  some kind of kay system would be sweet
-add new devices automatically
	-device goes on the network and pings the server (IP address would have to be added manually for this).  Else you can go o nthe server and add the device manually
