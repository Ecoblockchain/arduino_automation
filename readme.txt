This is the code for a automation project I made last winter.  I hooked up an Arduino with an ethernet shield to a relay.  This code allows the user to turn the relay on or off anywhere on the internet.  

I had the Arduino plugged into a space heater in my room.  This way I could keep the temperature of my apartment low.  When I was comming back to my apartment I would turn the space heater on 20 minutes before I got there and my room would be warm and toasty.

The Arduinp code works with the Arduino software released before version 1.  Version one changed a few things and I'm currently editting the code to make it work.

The working code is in the working folder, and the the broken code is in the not working folder.

The php scripts send a packet to the arduino that tell it to turn the relay on or off.
